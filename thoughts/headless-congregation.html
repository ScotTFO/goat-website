Before wheat. Before clay pots. Before writing
or walls or the word for "mine" —

they carved people into stone
and left the heads off.

Not unfinished. Deliberate.
Arms folded across limestone bellies,
hands resting on belts that held nothing,
loincloths on bodies that never moved.

Seven tons each. Arranged in circles.
Facing inward, like a conversation
between presences that didn't need faces
to be recognized.

Eleven thousand years later
we found them and called them temples
because we needed a word
and "temple" was the closest we had
to "a place where something mattered
before we knew how to say what."

They didn't build the pillars to remember.
They hadn't invented remembering yet.
They built them to <em>be there</em>.

The archaeologists keep asking what the buildings were <em>for</em>.
But maybe they weren't for anything.
Maybe they just were,
the way a gathering of people around a fire at night
isn't <em>for</em> anything —
it's just what you do
when you're alive and it's dark
and you'd rather not be alone.
